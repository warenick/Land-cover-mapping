## Project description 
We want to try and squeeze maximum performance for land cover mapping based on multi-modal remote sensing data: Sentinel-1 (C-band synthetic aperture radar) and Sentinel-2 (medium resolution multi-spectral imager) missions. 

## What makes it interesting/practical
The Sentinel missions by the European Space Agency provide medium resolution C-band SAR and multispectral images with global coverage every 12 days, and all this data is available for free. This makes Sentinel data a very important target for automated image processing / interpretation.

## Where would the data/parameters come from?
A SEN12MS dataset is available online under the CC-BY license.
